[{"content":"Welcome to False Productivity! Hello hello hello. I am super excited about this for some reason. I wanted to do a blog for quite some time but it was a little daunting to see that even a simple blogging website was difficult to make (if you want to make it properly, not talking about a blog website with vanilla JS) so I kept putting it off for a long time. I did have another website like this but that one didn\u0026rsquo;t use markdown because I thought markdown coudln\u0026rsquo;t render math. I never saw any math equations on GitHub and as far as I remember, I think I looked a teensy bit into and gave up immediately. Then finally I found some inspiration\u0026hellip;\nEnter tmwilliamlin168 I found this Youtube channel called William Lin and watched a few videos of his. Then I borderline stalked him, and found his blog. After seeing that, I felt like some sort of duty was enthrusted upon me, that I needed to make a blog, otherwise I would be very sad. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I felt like that but that really boosted my work rate for this project. I saw on his blog that he used NextJS and Tailwind CSS. So I decided that I would do the same. I went to learn NextJS. It said that I should first be familiar with ReatJS. So I went to learn ReactJS. Completed its tutorial in 6 hours and came back to learn NextJS\nThe Great Big Going While making their tutorial blog, I realized I HADN\u0026rsquo;T LEARNT SHIT. Literally everything in tha tutorial went over my head. That\u0026rsquo;s why I soon gave up on Next. Lol no I didn\u0026rsquo;t, I was way in over my head so I decided it was time to install Tailwind. I had no clue what I was doing. I hated Tailwind because it required me to actually know my CSS. So I got rid of it and tried out Bulma. This time I got a little further and managed to make a header for the landing page. It looked quite nice if I do say so myself. Then I gave up on NextJS because I discovered something amazing.\nStatic Site Generators FTW Yes, I discovered Jekyll. Then I discovered Hugo. Then I discovered PaperMod. Then I made this in 1 day. Life\u0026rsquo;s good.\n","permalink":"https://colossal-pepe.github.io/false-productivity/posts/2021-5/first-post/","summary":"Welcome to False Productivity! Hello hello hello.
