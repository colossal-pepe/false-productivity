[{"content":"Abridged Problem Statement Given 3 integers $a,b,c$, find all values of $x$ between 0 and 10^9 for which the equation $x=b\\cdot s(x)^a+c$ holds where $s(x)$ is the digit sum of $x$.\nSolution Since maximum value of $x$ is 10^9, a $\\mathcal{O}(x)$ solution is infeasible. So we need make the search space smaller. Let\u0026rsquo;s express the original equation in 2 ways:\n$$ x=b\\cdot s(x)^a + c \\tag{1} $$ $$ \\sqrt[a]{x-c \\over b} = s(x) \\tag{2} $$\nNotice that in equation 2, the left side might not be an integer and if $a \u0026gt; 1$, it might be irrational. We know that the set of positive integers is smaller than the set of rational and real numbers. So, if we can search in such a way that we omit all the non-integer values of $s(x)$ while searching for $x$, we will have reduced our search space by a lot. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s think about what $s(x)$ could be since we are only restricted to integers. Well its obvious that $s(x) \\geq 0$ and since maximum value of $x$ is 10^9, we can fill all digits with 9\u0026rsquo;s so that we have a 9 digit number with all 9\u0026rsquo;s. This means $0 \\leq s(x) \\leq 81$. Which means instead of searching through all values of $x$, we want to search through all possible values of $s(x)$. So for every $i$ between o and 81, we compute $x=b\\cdot i^a+c$ and check if $s(x)=i$ and if it is, we add it to our of solutions.\n#include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt;#include \u0026lt;vector\u0026gt;using namespace std; long long intPow(int b, int p) { long long ans = 1; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; p; i++) { ans *= b; } return ans; } int s(int x) { int dig_sum = 0; while (x) { dig_sum += x%10; x /= 10; } return dig_sum; } long long bound(int a) { if (a == 1) return 820000; else return 999999999; } bool validSolution(int i, int a, int b, int c) { return ((long long)i == s(intPow(i, a)*b + c)); } int main() { int a, b, c; cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; a \u0026gt;\u0026gt; b \u0026gt;\u0026gt; c; vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; v; for (int i = 1; b*intPow(i, a) + c \u0026lt;= bound(a); i++) { if (validSolution(i, a, b, c)) v.push_back(intPow(i,a)*b + c); } cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; v.size() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; for (int i: v) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; i \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39; \u0026#39;; } cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; return 0; } ","permalink":"https://colossal-pepe.github.io/false-productivity/posts/2021-5/little-dima-and-equation/","summary":"Abridged Problem Statement Given 3 integers $a,b,c$, find all values of $x$ between 0 and 10^9 for which the equation $x=b\\cdot s(x)^a+c$ holds where $s(x)$ is the digit sum of $x$.\nSolution Since maximum value of $x$ is 10^9, a $\\mathcal{O}(x)$ solution is infeasible.

Hello hello hello. I am super excited about this for some reason. I wanted to do a blog for quite some time but it was a little daunting to see that even a simple blogging website was difficult to make (if you want to make it properly, not talking about a blog website with vanilla JS) so I kept putting it off for a long time. I did have another website like this but that one didn\u0026rsquo;t use markdown because I thought markdown coudln\u0026rsquo;t render math. I never saw any math equations on GitHub and as far as I remember, I think I looked a teensy bit into and gave up immediately. Then finally I found some inspiration\u0026hellip;\nEnter tmwilliamlin168 I found this Youtube channel called William Lin and watched a few videos of his. Then I borderline stalked him, and found his blog. After seeing that, I felt like some sort of duty was enthrusted upon me, that I needed to make a blog, otherwise I would be very sad. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I felt like that but that really boosted my work rate for this project. I saw on his blog that he used NextJS and Tailwind CSS. So I decided that I would do the same. I went to learn NextJS. It said that I should first be familiar with ReatJS. So I went to learn ReactJS. Completed its tutorial in 6 hours and came back to learn NextJS\nThe Great Big Going While making their tutorial blog, I realized I HADN\u0026rsquo;T LEARNT SHIT. Literally everything in that tutorial went over my head. That\u0026rsquo;s why I soon gave up on Next. Lol no I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I was way in over my head so I decided it was time to install Tailwind. I had no clue what I was doing. But soon I ended up hating Tailwind because it required me to actually know CSS which was not gonna happen. So I got rid of it and tried out Bulma. This time I got a little further and managed to make a header for the landing page. It looked quite nice if I do say so myself. Then I proceeded to dump that entire project for something which was perfect for the job.\nStatic Site Generators FTW Yes, I discovered Jekyll. Then I discovered Hugo. Then I discovered PaperMod. Then I made this in 1 day. Life\u0026rsquo;s good.\n","permalink":"https://colossal-pepe.github.io/false-productivity/posts/2021-5/first-post/","summary":"Welcome to False Productivity!
