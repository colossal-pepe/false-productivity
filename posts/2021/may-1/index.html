<p>Hello hello hello. I am super excited about this for some reason. I wanted to do a blog for quite some time but it was a little daunting to see that even a simple blogging website was difficult to make (if you want to make it properly, not talking about a blog website with vanilla JS) so I kept putting it off for a long time. I did have another website like this but that one didn’t use markdown because I thought markdown couldn’t render math. I never saw any math equations on GitHub and as far as I remember, I think I looked a teensy bit into and gave up immediately. Then finally I found some inspiration…</p>
<h2 id="enter-tmwilliamlin168">Enter tmwilliamlin168</h2>
<p>I found this guy William Lin from <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/tmwilliamlin168">Codeforces</a> who is also a <a href="https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6990">IOI gold medalist</a>. I also found his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKuDLsO0Wwef53qdHPjbU2Q">youtube channel</a> and watched a videos of his. Then I borderline stalked him (if you don&rsquo;t consider finding his IOI profile and youtube channel stalking enough), and found his blog. After seeing that, I felt like some sort of duty was enthrusted upon me, that I needed to make a blog, otherwise I would be very sad. I don’t know why I felt like that but that really boosted my work rate for this project. I saw on his blog that he used NextJS and Tailwind CSS. So I decided that I would do the same. I went to learn NextJS. It said that I should first be familiar with ReatJS. So I went to learn ReactJS. Completed its tutorial in 6 hours and came back to learn NextJS</p>
<h2 id="the-great-big-going">The Great Big Going</h2>
<p>While making their tutorial blog, I realized I HADN’T LEARNT SHIT. Literally everything in that tutorial went over my head. That’s why I soon gave up on Next. Lol no I didn’t. I was way in over my head so I decided it was time to install Tailwind. I had no clue what I was doing. But soon I ended up hating Tailwind because it required me to actually know CSS which was not gonna happen. So I got rid of it and tried out Bulma. This time I got a little further and managed to make a header for the landing page. It looked quite nice if I do say so myself. Then I proceeded to dump that entire project for something which was perfect for the job.</p>
<h2 id="static-site-generators-ftw">Static site generators FTW</h2>
<p>Yes, I discovered Jekyll. Then I discovered Hugo. Then I discovered PaperMod. Then I made this in 1 day. Life’s good.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<ol>
<li>(25th Jan, 2022) Some time between now and 22nd May 2021, I kinda gave up on this blog because I couldn&rsquo;t find content that was satisfying enough for me to write. On the one hand, that&rsquo;s actually quite nice because it means my taste buds have matured for this stuff. But the fact remains that I still can&rsquo;t come up with cool things to put here. This implies that I still haven&rsquo;t become quite cool enough to write anything cool here :(. An obligatory analogical image:

I have also decided to switch to Ink from PaperMod. Unlike PaperMod, Ink was a pain in the aass to setup. This time, I <strong>did not</strong> make this in 1 day, unfortunately.</li>
