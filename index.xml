      <description>A seemingly unrelated counting problem We&amp;rsquo;ll start our journey with the following puzzle:
 Given is a $n \times m$ grid. The cell in the $i$th row and $j$th column is denoted as $(i, j)$. Count the number of paths from $(1,1)$ to $(n,m)$ if the only possible moves from a cell are move to the right or move below.
 It is recommended to ponder the problem for some time before moving on.</description>

      <description>Welcome to False Productivity! Hello hello hello. I am super excited about this for some reason. I wanted to do a blog for quite some time but it was a little daunting to see that even a simple blogging website was difficult to make (if you want to make it properly, not talking about a blog website with vanilla JS) so I kept putting it off for a long time. I did have another website like this but that one didn’t use markdown because I thought markdown couldn’t render math.</description>
